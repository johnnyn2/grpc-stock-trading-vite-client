# React (Vite) + Envoy (Proxy) + Spring Boot (gRPC)

This repository demostrate how web frontend can interact with backend using gRPC. 

Currently, two gRPC modes (unary and server-streaming) are implemented. Client-streaming and multi-dimensional modes are not not implemented:

Browser doesn't support HTTP/2 which is used by gRPC so it needs Envoy proxy to convert HTTP/1 to HTTP/2 request to the backend.

- [grpc-stock-trading-envoy](https://github.com/johnnyn2/grpc-stock-trading-envoy)
- [grpc-stock-trading-server](https://github.com/johnnyn2/grpc-stock-trading-server)

## React Vite

gRPC client is generated by protoc. Use below command
```
